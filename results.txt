These are the observations from training the model:
The model performs better when predicting final score(g3) using all the parameters including the previous 
scores(g1 and g2)
When predicting all the scores(g1 g2 g3) with the base and categorical parameters in the dataset, the model 
is not as accurate.

The error for the model that predicts only the final score is about 2.04

The error for the model that predicts all three scores is about 3.6
